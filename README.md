This is a sudoku solver. The python version has a visual solution while the c++ version only has text format solutions.

Python version can be runned from main.py.

Cpp version can be compiled and run.

In both versions you have to manually change the sudoku in code to the puzzel you want to solve.
For python this is done in main.py:


    board = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 9, 0],
        [0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8],
        [0, 0, 9, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2],
        [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
        [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7],
        [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
    ])

In cpp, you can change the board in driver.cpp:

    vector<vector<int>> board = {
        {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 9, 0},
        {0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8},
        {0, 0, 9, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0},
        {0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2},
        {6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0},
        {3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0},
        {0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7},
        {0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0}
        };
